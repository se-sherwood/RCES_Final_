READ ME: My final project repository for RCES. 

I plan to use <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod04.php">MODIS</a> data to determine how the distribution of cirrus cloud cover has changed over the past 18/19 years. I will examine the global monthly mean cirrus reflectance from MODIS for different seasons (JFM, FMA, etc.) and plot the trend for each grid on the globe. I will also take a time-series of the area average anomaly over defined regions (arctic, east asia, western pacific, etc.) to determine what regions have experienced an increase (decrease) in overall cirrus cloud cover during different seasons. I will determine the significance of each of these observations.
